<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? - It was pretty cool to transate what I've learned in the readings as well as Codecademy into an actual site. It's nice to use all the tags together in order to make a basic website layout and I'm looking forward to learning more HTML skills!
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? - It wasn't too much of a challenge using the HTML5 samantic elements. Implimenting was the easy part. There's just so many elements and tags that can be used that it takes a while to read through and make sure you've found what you're looking for!
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) - I tried not to use any formatting in this challenge, though I've used some style tags in previous work so it was hard not to incorporate them to make the layout more resemble the actual site.
- What seems good and bad about HTML? - What seems good about HTML is that it's pretty straihtforward. The elements that I've used don't have any tricky names so it's easy to know and remember what each does. The challenging part for me was remembering to close each tag, especially when there are several consecutive ones. Initially, it was easy when just doing the title tag, but when adding the sections followed by paragraphs, or inserting photos that linked to another page, it got tricky to remember where to close each tag, and in what to order to insert them.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? - I have two main tricks. The first is to add the closing tag before inserting text. This helps me not have to worry about where to place the end tag if I'm inserting a lot of text in between. The second trick is to refresh the page that I'm creating often in the web browser. Not waiting to the end helps clear up any funky formatting or issues early in the process so they won't have piled up once you've completing the code.
