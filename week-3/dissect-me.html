				<h1>Week 1: Version Control</h1></header>
			<div><p>There's been a lot to cover in the past couple of weeks... computer systems setup, introductions, Google Hangouts, and now we're diving a little into version control and a bit of code! So many interesting topics to cover but I've been doing my best try not to go on too long about each aspect of the git commands and all the functions on the command line in my reflections. Overall, it's been a lot to take in - at least for someone coming from a non-tech background. I'm currently working in the translation industry and though I'm passionate about foreign languages and love my job, after trying out programming I've just been hooked and so intrigued by what you can create once you develp a foundation.</p>

			<p>As we're just a week or so in, I'm clearly still developing this foundation, but it's been quite interesting what I've learned so far! There's been walk-through videos, hands-on practice, and a great community to reach out to if there's ever any questions. Although I've gone over some of these commands before, most of the material is new, so it takes a bit of time before fully understanding the concepet. Luckily, there's been plenty of readings to cover and explain the material in more than one way, and after a bit of practice during the assignments it's starting to all sink in.</p>

<-- Reflection: 

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why? - We used the standard HTML skeleton tags, like title, body, html, and head, as well as section, div, and the paragraph tags. These seem to be tags that I've used over and over again. It seems that most html pages have the standard semantic tags that are used regardless of the content. I've used these on many previous challenges and will probably continue to use them as they help create the general layout of the website. 

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? - Elements are laid out on the page in the order which you add the tags in the html document around the html tags. Surrounding all the content on the webpage are the html tags which will wrap from the start to the end of the page. Usually within the html tag is the head tag. With the exception of the title tag, information stored in the head tag will contain the metadata and will not be displayed on the webpage, such as chartsets and styles. From there the browser reads the html from top to bottom. It will then read the  information in the body, and will continue through each tag until it reaches the closing html tag at the end of the page. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? - I learned that html can create snippets which are similar to templates that can be used for the starting layout for html page. I will certainly create more snippets in a later date, as this will reduce the amount of skeletons I have to recreate.  In addition to a basic layout, I also learned that by opening an html tag in sublime and hitting the tab button, that will automatically generate the html skelenton, which comes in handy as it'll save time in having to manually type in every tag. I'm familiar with a few other shortcuts for sublime in general, such as highlighting a tag and pressing command + D in order to highlight all similar sections in the text if you need to make revisions, and I learned yesterday that pressing command + option + shift + f formats html so that the tags are all aligned. It came in handy when I added a bunch of tags in between text and couldn't tell where I was missing an end tag!
